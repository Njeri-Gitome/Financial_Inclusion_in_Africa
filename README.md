## About
You are asked to predict the likelihood of the person having a bank account or not (Yes = 1, No = 0), for each unique id in the test dataset . You will train your model on 70% of the data and test your model on the final 30% of the data, across four East African countries - Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.

The main dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa.
